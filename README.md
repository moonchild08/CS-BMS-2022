In 11th grade, I developed my first programâ€”a Bank Management system in Python. The program serves as an educational tool to demonstrate basic banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Upon starting, users are prompted to either login or register. Existing users can login with their username and password, while new users must register by providing their age. The system then generates a new account number automatically. As an incentive, the first 100 users receive an initial credit of 500 rupees; subsequent accounts start with a zero balance.

The program offers seven key features:
1. **Customer Details**: View detailed customer information.
2. **Account Details**: Check account specifics such as account number and balance.
3. **Transaction**: Perform transactions like deposits and withdrawals.
4. **Transaction Details**: View transaction history and current balance.
5. **Update Profile**: Edit personal information, including the address.
6. **Delete Account**: Remove an account from the system.
7. **Quit**: Exit the program.

This project not only solidified my understanding of OOP but also gave me practical experience in developing user-interactive software.
